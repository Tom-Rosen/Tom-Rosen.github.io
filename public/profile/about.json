    "about": " Hi, my name is Tom Rosen, I'm soon to be graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Game Design (May 2024).\n\n\n In the future I hope to get hired full-time as a software developer, working on frontend, UI/UX software. I'm super interested in exploring how A.I. can be used to change how we design and devlop applications. \n\n In my free time, you can find me camping, playing video games, working on personal projects, and going on fun vacations with friends and family. \n\n If you're looking to contact me, feel free to reach out at my email: trrosen@wisc.edu, or my personal number: 314-718-9629.",
